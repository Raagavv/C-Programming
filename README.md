# TASK-1
**Description**

This program demonstrates various file operations in the C programming language, including creating a file, reading data from a file, writing data to a file, and appending data to an existing file. It uses standard C library functions such as fopen, fprintf, fscanf, and fclose to perform these operations.

# Task-2
**Description**

The C program provided implements a singly linked list with modular and efficient operations, including insertion (at the beginning and end), deletion, and traversal. The program also includes error handling for memory allocation and invalid operations.

# Task-3
**Description**

This program implements a simple lexical analyzer that processes an input file to identify and categorize lexical tokens such as keywords, operators, and identifiers. A lexical analyzer (or lexer) is a fundamental component of a compiler that breaks down source code into meaningful tokens for further processing.

# Task-4
**Description**

This program implements a basic data compression algorithm using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). RLE is a simple and efficient lossless compression technique that replaces sequences of the same character with a single instance of the character followed by its frequency. The program also supports decompression to reconstruct the original text from the compressed data.
